                    The devil doesn’t always hurt you head on, happiness isn’t always brought by God. 
                    The devil can make you happy too, for a long time even, but it will fade one day and 
                    you will be plunged into the depths of despair. God does the same. So what’s the difference? 
                    I believe it’s how you react when the happiness is gone, when trees no longer represent 
                    lively nature, but a good way to hang, when ceiling fans become less than just a tool to cool 
                    oneself in the summer heat. That’s when you realize who sent the pleasure and what was its nature.

                    I believe that the brief 2 months of happiness brought in my life was nothing but devil’s play. 
                    I decided to let go of it and move on to happiness that might actually be real. It may or may not last, 
                    but it won’t come back to bite me and I’ll find a way to survive better and cope when times aren’t yellow anymore.
